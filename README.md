# Front End MVC in a Nutshell
## Introduction
___
The Front End MVC in a Nutshell project is a collection of bite-sized code samples/snippets which aim to help you on your way to becoming a Front End MVC app developer using BackboneJS and Angular.js. The main objective for this compilation is that there is often a lack of simple examples to get started with most MVC frameworks. Do keep in mind that the code samples here are still just supporting material, and are mainly to help avoid getting stuck.


However, do keep in mind the project is **still in development** and many samples, and topics, area still not yet created/planned. I currently do this on my freetime, so any help with it is greatly appreciated. See Contributing section at the end for more information.
